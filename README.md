Code accompanying RSE2019 talk "Autograd: A cool software trick for avoiding maths", an introduction to autograd. Simple python notebooks that introduce AutoDiff (automatic differentiation) and AutoGrad package (usage of _grad_ only). See presentation at [autograd.pdf](./autograd.pdf)

* **AutoDiff** notebook is a pure-Python implementation and uses no imports
* **AutoGrad** notebook uses two imports: autograd and matplotlib for plotting

Recommended order of using the notebooks: AutoDiff -> AutoGrad
